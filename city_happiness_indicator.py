"""
It is a lot more fun if this data is personal to you. 
Go to the training set data (metro_100_train) and clear out all the data. Keep the header row.
Now, find 10 cities where you can say whether you would definitely want to live there (at least 3 cities)/definitely not want to live there (at least 3 cities). Try to find at least 10 overall. 
If the city is somewhere you want to live, put a 1 in Column A.
If the city is somewhere you do not live, put a 0 in Column A.
Fill out the rest of the columnn information for each city (copy/paste works).
Now when you run the script, the model will be trained on your preferences!
